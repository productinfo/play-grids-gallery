Creating a new project from this template project
-------------------------------------------------

1. Check out this template project, to somewhere with parent directory where you'll want checkouts of the other projects.

2. From the checkout directory, run the duplicate script to create a new repository, replacing `<BitBucket username>` with your BitBucket username and `<New Repo Name>` with the name of the git repository you want to create (it should be prefixed with "play-"):

        . ./duplicate.sh -u <BitBucket username> -r <New Repo Name>
   This should duplicate the template project into a new repository on BitBucket, check out the project into the parent dir of the template project, and cd you into the new checkout.
    
3. From the newly created directory, open "GridsGallery" in Xcode and rename the project (click twice on project name in the Project Navigator, then follow the instructions, choosing to rename project content items). Close the project.

4. **Make sure you're in the checkout of the new project not the template project.** Run the rename script (replacing `<New Project Name>` with your new name):

        ./rename.sh <New Project Name>

5. Edit **\<New Project Name\>.podspec** to fill in the summary, description, repo name, and frameworks.

6. Build your project.

7. Save a screenshot to **screenshot.png**.

8. Edit the rest of this file so it makes sense (the bits to change are in ***bold italics*** [or at least surrounded by lots of asterisks] - please remove the formatting as well as editing them!), and remove everything up to and including this point -> .

Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of Shinobi***Charts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges***. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the ***[ShinobiCharts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges website](link to appropriate section)***.

If you've used the installer to install Shinobi***Charts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges***, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped Shinobi***Charts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges***, open up the project in Xcode, and drag Shinobi***Charts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges***.framework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up **MyProjectNameViewController.m** and add the following line inside `viewDidLoad`:

    [Shinobi***Charts/Grids/Essentials/Gauges*** setLicenseKey:@"your license key"];
